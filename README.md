# Minimalistic React website

> React, Next.js, ESlint, Sass, PostCSS

## Description

Personal website used as an object of experimentation. See [live](http://www.martosjose.com)

## Motivation

While Webpack and friends can be great allies, Next.js not only makes React in the server straightforward, but also "config-free". It gives better performance since the page is rendered server-side, what improves the SEO too. It also comes with a powerful tool to export your (simple) website to be static, not dependant on the server.

The goal was to turn the [vuewebsite](https://github.com/josemartos/vuewebsite) project into React using Next.js

## Setup

install modules

```sh
npm install
```

development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

production / static

```sh
npm run export
```
